# game-viewer
A website that lists video-games. We can traverse the site, see games, watch screenshots, trailers and playable platforms.<br />
Made it for fun and to learn and improve my javascript skills, the hash navigation is still a WIP. 
The website was made with HTML5 Boilerplate template.<br /> <br /> 

### Dependencies  <br />
